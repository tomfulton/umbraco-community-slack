# Code of Conduct

umbracians.chat is a Slack community run by members of the Umbraco community. It is a place for people to connect with each other and share ideas and help each other out. This code of conduct helps set guidelines for the community to follow so it can be a positive experience for everyone. By use of the slack channel you are accepting and agreeing to abide by these code of conduct guidelines. 

### Respect the Umbraco values

The Umbraco Slack community is member supported and not managed by HQ. However, we still ask that you respect the Umbraco informal code of conduct which can be found here: https://our.umbraco.com/code-of-conduct. 

We also ask the following...

### Be nice

Be friendly to others in the Slack community. Keep the atmosphere positive and helpful.  

### Unacceptable Behavior

The Umbraco Slack community should be a friendly experience for everyone. Unacceptable behaviors include discrimination or harassment in any form, threats or violent language, posting explicit material, and insulting others.

Moderators reserve the right to delete posts, content, or block users from the slack channel for any of these behaviors. Depending on the severity of the behavior, users may first receive a warning prior to being banned, and will then be banned if behavior continues. 

### Reporting Guidelines

To report incidents or violations of the code of conduct, or to discuss a decision, such as a ban, please contact umbracians.chat@gmail.com.
