# Umbraco Community Slack #

![](http://umbracians-chat.herokuapp.com/badge.svg)

### What is it? ###
A 24-7 room for Umbraco community members to chat. Loitering is encouraged. 

### Why does it exist? ###
Umbraco Community Slack was created to help all Umbracians across the world stay in touch and communicate with each other, in real time. Now we can have ad-hoc conversations about Umbraco related stuff (ok...and maybe some other things) on any given day, online. 

### How do I get in? ###
Signup by visiting [http://umbracians-chat.herokuapp.com/](http://umbracians-chat.herokuapp.com/), once signed up use [https://umbracians.slack.com/](https://umbracians.slack.com/)

## Guidelines

### Creating New Channels ###
In order to help keep Slack approachable and maintainable, we've set up just a handful of new channels.  Have an idea for a channel?  Suggest it in `#slack-community`.

### `@everyone` `@channel`, or `@group` ###
Slack provides this syntax to send mass notifications.  We've chosen to keep these disabled for now given the vast timezone differences in the community.  Instead, please use the `#announcements` channel to share big news with the world.  Team Owners and Admins can still distribute notifications via `@everyone`, `@channel`, or `@group`, but only when warranted.

### Questions, ideas, suggestions? ###
Post in `#slack-community` or create an issue on GitHub.  This is an experimental project.  We'd love your feedback! 

### Keep in mind... ###
This is not meant to be a replacement for forums, twitter or other official means of communication & support.  We encourage you to be cognizant of whether a discussion could benefit others that may not be on Slack and share these with the community via other means.
